# The third party config file is used to define projects that you program against.
# Use it when you are unsure about the versions published to external egg baskets,
# or versions packaged with your OS. For example the version of Twisted that comes
# with ubuntu has been customised for various apps and may/maynot cause problems
# with your app.
